When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to use remote repository when i am working on combine projects with others so that my colleages can edit this projects whenever they want to.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When combine project are on remote repository, every members of team are editing the project. So it is important that we import the changes to local repository by pulling changes manually.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
The forks are only used on Github to copy ones repository to my repository. The clone is used between Local repositories and also between Github and local repository. The branches are only used in local repository to describe new features or updating the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can access all remote commits offline upto last known state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We can use Dropbox or manual editing by sending files via mails, but that would be hard and tedious. Git and Github would be more easier since it allows automatic manual track versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a separate branch when you don't want to mess with the master branch. Benefits for separate branch: collaboration is promoted.
